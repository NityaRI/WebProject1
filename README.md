OVERVIEW

This project focuses on building an intelligent healthcare recommender system that predicts diseases based on patient symptoms. Along with predicting the disease, it provides a detailed description, recommended precautions, medications, workouts, and diet suggestions.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

In today’s fast-paced world, access to immediate healthcare guidance is limited, particularly for individuals who may not have easy access to medical professionals. Many people experience symptoms but delay consulting doctors either due to minor negligence, lack of awareness, or logistical challenges.There is a growing need for an intelligent, user-friendly system that can analyze patient-reported symptoms, predict possible diseases, and recommend appropriate precautions, medications, diets, and workouts to support early intervention and healthy living.The goal is to develop a Smart Healthcare Recommender System that accurately predicts diseases based on patient symptoms and provides comprehensive healthcare advice.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Smart Healthcare Recommender System is an AI-based solution designed to assist users in identifying potential diseases based on their reported symptoms. By leveraging machine learning classification models, the system predicts the most probable disease a patient might be suffering from and recommends appropriate precautions, medications, diet plans, and workout suggestions to support their recovery and overall health.

The project workflow includes:

->Symptom Input: Users can input symptoms they are experiencing.

->Disease Prediction: The system processes the symptoms using trained machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest) to predict the disease.

Healthcare Recommendations:

->Disease Description: Provides an overview of the predicted disease.

->Precautions: Suggests safety measures to prevent worsening conditions.

->Medications: Recommends general medicines (informative, not prescriptive).

->Diet and Workouts: Offers lifestyle guidance to support healing and health.

The backend of the system is powered by Python and Flask, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a user-friendly web application. The datasets used contain records of symptoms, diseases, recommended medications, precautions, and diet charts, ensuring a comprehensive healthcare support experience. Overall, this system aims to empower users with quick healthcare insights and promote better health management through accessible technology.

TECHNOLOGY STACK

Frontend: HTML5 — For webpage structure and layout. CSS3 — For styling the web pages. Bootstrap — For responsive and attractive UI design.

Backend: Python — Main programming language for machine learning models and server-side logic. Flask — Lightweight web framework to connect the front-end with machine learning models.

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (sklearn) — For building and training classification models (SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.). Pandas — For data manipulation and preprocessing. NumPy — For numerical operations. Pickle — For saving and loading the trained ML models.

Dataset: Symptom-to-disease mapping dataset (custom/preprocessed). Precautions, medications, and diet datasets related to diseases.

Tools and Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code — For code development. Google Colab (optional) — For model training and quick testing (if needed). Git/GitHub — For version control and project hosting (optional but recommended).
